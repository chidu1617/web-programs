        We have always had an unspoken bond between us. I know I can always
         count on you to be there for me. With love and lots of affection.&#128536;<br>
         <br>You are  my everything, and to me you make the world a betteplace. 
         this  birthday today is no different as there is so much, I want to tell
          you, so many things I want to thank you for.&#128539;Too many thoughts to put
           into these few lines, but I hope they convey the love I have for you.
